* Edit /etc/pam.d/system-auth

Change the line that says;

-session    optional      pam_systemd.so

to;

-session    optional      pam_elogind.so

* Edit /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.login1.policy

To allow shutdown from the GNOME desktop, find the line that says:

<action id="org.freedesktop.login1.power-off">

below that you will see a line that says;

<allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>

change "auth_admin_keep" to "yes", like so;

<allow_active>yes</allow_active>

To allow reboot from the GNOME desktop, find the line taht says:

<action id="org.freedesktop.login1.reboot">

below that you will see a line that says;

<allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>

change "auth_admin_keep" to "yes".

* halt, poweroff, reboot under openrc

The above commands does not work under openrc. The command used for openrc is

"openrc-shutdown --poweroff now" to poweroff

"openrc-shutdown --halt now" to halt

"openrc-shutdown --reboot" to reboot

loginctl (poweroff and reboot) does not work.

To work around the issue, backup those 3 commands, like;

# mv /sbin/halt /sbin/halt~

# mv /sbin/poweroff /sbin/poweroff~

# mv /sbin/reboot /sbin/reboot~

Then create executable shell scripts in place of them. Example, for poweroff

#!/bin/bash

openrc-shutdown --poweroff now

loginctl poweroff will now work
