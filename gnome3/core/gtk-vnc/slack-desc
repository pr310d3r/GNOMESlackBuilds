# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gtk-vnc:
gtk-vnc: GTK-VNC is a VNC viewer widget for GTK+. It is built using coroutines,
gtk-vnc: allowing it to be completely asynchronous while remaining single
gtk-vnc: threaded. It supports RFB protocols 3.3 through 3.8 and the VeNCrypt
gtk-vnc: authentication extension providing SSL/TLS encryption with x509 
gtk-vnc: certificate authentication. The core library is written in C and a
