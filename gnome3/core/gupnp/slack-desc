# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# # the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gupnp: GUPnP (OSS framework for creating UPnP)
gupnp:
gupnp: GUPnP is an elegant, object-oriented open source framework for
gupnp: creating UPnP devices and control points, written in C, using GObject
gupnp: and libsoup. The GUPnP API is intended to be easy to use, efficient
gupnp: and flexible. It provides the same set of features as libupnp, but
gupnp: shields the developer from most of UPnP's internals.
