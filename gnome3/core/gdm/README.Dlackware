Please remove the following lines from /etc/dbus-1/system.conf to get GDM working properly:
  <!-- Allow root to do anything over the messagebus.
       Don't whine about "security" - anyone with root privileges
       can edit this file anyway, so -ENOHOLE here. -->
  <policy user="root">
    <allow send_destination="*"/>
    <allow send_interface="*"/>
  </policy>

or replace /etc/dbus-1/system.conf with the standard DBus configuration file (Slackware modifies this one).
